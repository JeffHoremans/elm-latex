# elm-latex
This is a first attempt at LaTeX syntax highlighting for the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/). 

See [highlighting-test.tex](highlighting-test.tex) for a sample LaTeX file that uses the [elm-highlighting.sty](elm-highlighting.sty) package.

If you try it and notice any bugs, please create an issue. Thanks!
